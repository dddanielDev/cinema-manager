## ðŸ“‹ Description

The Cinema Management System is an application designed to help manage a cinema. It allows administrators to define cinema halls, add movies, and create schedules (repertoires) based on this data. Each hall can have different seating configurations. Movies include basic information such as title, duration, and genre.

The system improves organization and helps automate cinema operations.
